Decision Trees and Random Forests - Classification Task
This project demonstrates the use of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for a supervised classification task.

🎯 Objective
To learn and implement tree-based models for classification using scikit-learn, visualize decision trees, understand overfitting, and interpret feature importances.

🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python
Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
matplotlib, seaborn
Graphviz (optional, for visualization)

📁 Files
decision_trees_random_forests.ipynb — Main notebook with model implementation and analysis
README.md — Project summary and instructions

📌 Workflow Summary
Data Loading
Loaded a classification dataset relevant to the task (e.g., Heart Disease Dataset)
Model 1: Decision Tree
Trained a decision tree classifier
Visualized the tree
Controlled depth to prevent overfitting
Model 2: Random Forest
Trained a random forest classifier
Compared accuracy with the decision tree
Analyzed overfitting improvement
Feature Importance
Extracted and visualized feature importances from the random forest model
Evaluation
Compared models using accuracy score
Used cross-validation for robust performance evaluation

📊 Key Insights
Decision Tree is intuitive but prone to overfitting without depth control.
Random Forest reduces overfitting using bagging and averaging across multiple trees.
Feature Importances help interpret model decisions and understand key drivers in predictions.
